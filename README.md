Here are the details for the **README.md** file, which outlines how to set up and run the **AgriSense: AI-Powered Crop Health Monitoring System** project.

### README.md

```markdown
# AgriSense: AI-Powered Crop Health Monitoring System

### Description
AgriSense is a software solution designed to help farmers detect crop diseases and predict crop health. By leveraging machine learning (CNN-based image classification), the system allows farmers to upload images of their crops and receive disease predictions. This empowers farmers to make timely interventions and take necessary actions to safeguard crop health.

### Features
- **Crop Disease Detection**: Upload crop images to detect diseases.
- **Prediction Results**: Display disease predictions based on AI models.
- **Frontend Interface**: User-friendly React.js interface for easy interaction.
- **Backend Integration**: FastAPI backend with MongoDB to manage image uploads and predictions.

### How to Run the Project

#### 1. Set up the Backend

1. Navigate to the `Backend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn api.main:app --reload
   ```

4. Access the API documentation at:
   [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

#### 2. Set up the Frontend

1. Navigate to the `Frontend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd Frontend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend React app:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open the web app in your browser:
   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

#### 3. Testing the Application

1. Visit the frontend app at `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Upload an image of your crop.
3. The system will process the image and predict the crop disease.
4. The result will be displayed as a prediction on the screen.

### Notes

- **Backend**: The backend is built using FastAPI and handles image uploads and predictions using a pre-trained CNN model.
- **Frontend**: The frontend is a simple React.js app that allows users to upload images and view predictions.
- **Database**: MongoDB is used to store crop images and their corresponding predictions.
- **Model**: The CNN model used for disease detection is pre-trained and saved in the `models/plant_disease_model.h5` file.

### Troubleshooting

- Make sure MongoDB is running on your local machine or configure the database URI to use a cloud MongoDB service.
- Ensure you have installed the necessary dependencies for both frontend and backend.
